        "blog_content": "Ahhhh! The year full of remembrances, blithe memories, success paradigms, failure remarks and what not, a year to remember for ages to come. 2014, you beauty! Contentment, Happiness, Satisfaction, Achievement, Success, Failure, Inspiration, Leadership just to name a few burnished this insouciant girl. Who says dreams don’t come true? 2014 is a perfect example to bolster the very notion “Dreams do turn to reality”. To live a beautiful life, challenge yourself each day to achieve something big. Dream big and have the courage to follow your dreams. Imagine things beyond measure. Don’t restrict yourself to so-called boundaries. Let your imagination go wide. Colour your dreams. Things are tagged as ‘Possible’ only after you achieve them. Work on a quixotic plan, if your will persists to. Do whatever you want in your life. Make mistakes and be happy after you straighten up a tangled rope. This was a closure to life/2014.The year began with a wider vision and a bigger goal. 2013 ended after shouldering on big responsibilities to be fulfilled in this coming year. Somehow, the heart knew the year would simply be great. And there was happiness all around. Sometimes I used to wonder, am I dreaming? How could things just go perfectly well? There was never any scope of resentment or distress. As if things were correcting themselves, they were trying to fill out this incomplete life. Everything was all set. All of a sudden from nowhere, people started listening to you. People started following you. People started praising for those good deeds. And I am like… Oh really? Have I achieved that greatness? Well then, if you accept things happily they really fall in correct place at correct time. With constant motivation, inspiration from all angles I started working really very hard and just to prove to myself, Yes, You are indeed great!Back then, I was a part of technical society of my college, Indian Society of Technical Education. Never worked that hard in the previous years to be able to sworn in at the acme. But this 2014 has some magic in itself, it just didn’t allow me to dream small. I gave all of me to begin realising the most impractical target ever. With the grace of all that hardships that I put in and yeah… some other imaginary stuff, the once silent girl was being declared to rule a committee. Dammn! That breathe freaking moment… My god, now this is really a dream. I need to get up as fast as I could. With no surprise, this was a reality. Some great men told “Hard work pays off”. Yes, it did! That provoked me to dream still bigger, because dreams do turn to reality.Life is cool, if you could unlock the fourth dimension of living. Live for someone’s smile. Live to love someone. There comes a moment, when you hear songs out of nowhere. The flying birds, the blowing breeze has some message to say. Everything around you seems so lovely. You start feeling so high because there is someone out there to catch you when you fall. The days were amazing. Glad that life taught me ‘love lessons’ too. The merrier are the heart breaks, because they actually mend you to a person, you should be. The lessons were tough, but then their significance was appreciable. Now that you have a definite rule sheet to not fall for someone innocently, instead to develop a connection between the red auricles and the grey cells. Pretty needed lessons.The life lessons will be incomplete if you haven’t faced any trauma of failing at something. Yes, I failed a heck lot of times. It was Placement session of my college. And as every ambitious student would demand a great job, I too had a similar mind-set. The will to achieve was never that big. Don’t know, never wanted that for myself. It was just a ‘thing’ to boast upon among the accolades. I wanted to do something different. Something that could suffice my ardent feelings, something that could actually understand that way I work, something that could respect my creativity in my domain, something that could give me the freedom to do things the way I want to, something that just couldn’t tag me as a black-suited professional, something more than that. This my-very-own interest was pouring down. I wanted a polished job, just to brag about it. Perfectly said, you will get it if you want it bad enough. I didn’t get a charming job. Yes, to suffice the title of being placed I got a job in the company I was least interested to work for. The situation was, if not this then nothing. Still, the mind believes there is something in the universe that serves as a lucky-charm to get things done for you at the right time. He somehow know what actually I want and will get that for me at right time. The much needed lessons of failure. Failure makes you humble, a person of respect. And I am happy here, that I didn’t get the things that easily. Let me make my success story worth notifying.Before this wonderful year ends, let me thank all those who contributed to make it that big and beautiful. You made me a fellow human-being. The daddy’s girl now understands how the world works. Positivity all around, with bigger hopes I am all set to sail the ship to still farer destinations. To do something worthwhile in the coming days to add one more reason to remember this year with pride. Happy 2-0-1-4!\n\t\t\t\t\t",

        "blog_content": "Getting up early morning, mind all filled with enthusiasm to brim. The excitement to live the very day cheers up the inner soul. Yes, those were the times when there was no place for sorrows, bad memories. It was happiness all around. Happiness surrounded all over the lane and all you could see was those bright green leaves dancing on their rhyme. The small ever beautiful birds chirping as if broadcasting some letter to their mates. The blue dome, that cloudy sky creates an environment to walk to infinite miles looking at how clouds move at their own pace. Everything was so bright and colourful. The lustrous rainbow hidden behind black sky trying to find its place to make the scene look all the more charming. Everyone was enjoying the pace at which we all were revolving around the bright wowsome sun. Life was amazing then! The cheerful thoughts to paint the earth with still more bright colours yelled with a powerful roar. Yes, I wanted those green leaves to shine like pearls and diamonds. I wanted raindrops to be still more wonderful filling up the essence. I wanted everything to be still more melodious. And that was the feeling after getting up every morning and watching this amazing scene.You see good when you feel good. I thought the world is all sunshine and rainbows. There is no place for hatred and people are unaware of the fact that there exists an opposite of happiness. I never knew the world is all mean and nasty place. It is the beautiful sparks that shine only from outside. The people living in this very own place doesn’t actually resemble the ambience. I never knew they all have many faces and they portray their feelings accordingly. They will be good to those who are good to them. The only thing they want was a seven letter fancy word ‘SUCCESS’ and if you don’t possess one, please make yourself comfortable leaving this queue of geniuses. The only thing worth appreciating was competition. Live your life at your own pace and enjoy the ongoing as you move on every bit of it. But then the reality was far more different. Brace yourself up and fight like a fighter at every moment of time. Be ready for the competition at every walk of your life. You always have to conquer the summit. No matter what you are feeling, you need to give your best. Achieving the goal was more important and the only goal of life. An innocent voice from inside recalled “Am I not allowed to be what I am. To walk and run at my own pace. To do what I want to.” Why does everything matter so much? Why people think way beyond my understanding. Why they just can’t pour out what actually they are thinking. Why is there a need to manipulate thoughts and make them look clearer? Why the heck I should follow all the norms and rules? Why can’t I fly like a free bird?There is so much more to life when you live it in the most unorganised way possible. Why follow a definite rule sheet with all your goals listed and acquiring them one by one. I want to live a beautiful life at my own pace and make it all the more charming. I just don’t want myself to be suited as a perfect icon. I want myself to be distinct from all those mediocre following a well-defined success strategy. I just hate perfection. Being perfect in your way and the way you like it makes you still more perfect. At this stage of time, I want to give up on all those past limelight and start over again. I want to live again and again till I find out what life is!I don’t want to be a programmed bot who calculates arithmetic equations at lightning speed. I want to be the one who cares how x dances over the rhyme of y in those finely spaced graphical lines. I want to see the world. I don’t care if x is accessible in my domain of program. I do care if I could let my magic work to make x do what he wishes to do. ",

I want to change the way the world thinks, I want to innovate to a better living. Nonetheless, I want to be the happiest person on this earth.”Yes, certainly. The dream of any average person who wish to aspire in life with glowing colours. The one who spends all his life working hard just to enjoy his future years in a well-furnished white dome. The one who craves to build a beautiful world and construct powerful technologies strives whole day to put in his maximum potential.All through my life, I have been thinking- ‘Just one big Idea’. Gosh! Once I get hit on this one powerful idea I will change the way the world thinks and would achieve the above mentioned paradigm. People will remember me when they will use my invention. Probably, like they remember Mark Zuckerberg while posting their new profile picture. Bill Gates, like they remember him when their black machine loses all its life and simply restart button will make your day.",

        "blog_content": "I want to be a writer. When I write about a beautiful incident happened the other day, I feel I am living it all over again. I like writing about imaginary stuff, I like imagining all trees talking to each other in their imaginary dome as “Hey, you look too green today!” I like being lost when I am counting stars as to how the farthest star will communicate to its siblings. Yes, writing takes me to other world. But hold on, if there’s something that you like doing and helps you forget all the bad things you had, why not do it daily? Because you think, you don’t write well. You think, your vocabulary is sparse. You think, your grammar is always out of the sense. Just because not many appreciated your thinking, doesn’t mean you will stop writing and give weird excuses as to why you are not doing what you like. And moreover, sit back and realise how much effort have you actually poured in to make it look beautiful? Have you tried enough? Have you analysed if you have learned something new that would brighten it up still more? No. Because again, that comes under living life out of comfort zone. And you don’t want to change yourself, you want to live a very systematic and planned life.",

        "blog_content": "Human’s best friend is satisfaction. We all tend to satisfy ourselves at one point of our time. We console ourselves that we are leading a prime life and that I am happy with it. We all bound ourselves in our comfort zone, thinking, getting out of it will put me in jeopardy. We get used to our normal routine, that any disturbance or deviation in it seriously aggravates our anger. We don’t like changes anymore. We feel things should remain constant as they are and let not challenges cross my way. Climbing a mountain, trekking, or any adventurous sport is just not what I do! All I do is live my routine life. A slight pinch of deviation even in my meal disturbs me. Clearly, we are not here to live a very concerned and articulated life. We are here to explore life, to know what it has for me! We are here to face the challenges and come out of them as a shining star. Only then, your level increases by one. Being intelligent, yet sticking to the same daily plans doesn’t raise your level. Your level increase when you do varied things.A student getting average grades all through his primary and secondary section remains satisfied if he is not challenged further to achieve more. I agree, a student should have interest in what he is doing only then you can ask him to stretch himself in that field a little more every day. By following a normal pace of life, we become passive. We lose interest in what is going around. If you have to catch up with the world and ace higher, surely you have to be better than what you were yesterday. Having no competition and not learning anything new is same as being a trained robot living in his area of expertise.If you want to grow, if you want to develop yourself, that won’t come from mere thinking. You have to act. You have to work for it day in and day out to make it happen. If you really have dreams, you should have the ability to fulfil them. If you are just a dreamer, then that will eventually disappoint you in long run. Dare to dream and then dare to make it a reality and that is true happiness. We have great people in our world to applaud for, all of them strived hard to excel in their field. We don’t hear any success stories made out of sheer luck. That’s because it’s only the hardwork and perseverance that helps you reach your goal.There are two types of people, one who want to grow and there are others. One who wants to grow face the maximum challenges each day and acing them is all they look for. Clearly, if you do something new, it won’t come to you bare handed, you have to work hard to get it in your plate.",

        "blog_title": "WHEN YOUR HEART TRIES TO RULE YOUR BRAIN!",
        "blog_content": "It’s a common luxury to listen to your heart and do things as you wish. People feel like they are living at the edge of satisfaction and happiness, when they do things they really like doing. Artists says, painting, literature is what gives them inner happiness. A coder says, building applications takes me to the top of the world. There are tons of motivational speeches to lure people to follow their passion, to do what they like. People say, you like sports, go for it, doesn’t matter what the end result is, give it a try. People say, you like dancing or writing or anything else, go for it. Follow your passion.Yes, I am suffering from this disease of ‘Follow your passion’. Whenever I didn’t feel like doing anything, I used to convince myself that, it is absolutely fine, this is not something I like, so don’t bother about it much. I never understood what passion is, in true sense. I always mocked my brain saying you are a hypothetical robot. I don’t want to listen to you. I will do what I like. In the realm of following my heart whispers, I end up losing quite a chunk of my success. Because my heart always want me to relax and stay comfortable. Our mind is a very smart device. It lures your body to stay comfortable and rest because that is what we like doing. Brain takes practical decision, forces you to get up and get it going, taking in to consideration the consequences. But we name it ‘The Passion’. We fool our brain that this is not what I want to do. You are completely wrong. I want to do something else and I will find it what I like doing.Now, let’s talk about passion. What the heck is Passion? Does everyone has a knack over a skill inherently? Do they get it as an asset? From where this passion comes from? How do I know I am about passionate about something? There is where we lack. We don’t know what our passion is and we keep fooling our brain as why I don’t want to get hold of some other thing. We fail to understand passion develops after you give enough time to make your skill strong. Passion develops after you devote enormous time to make it real. Passion is not something that comes flying to you. Passion is something that you have to acquire by following a determined schedule. By staying motivated and thinking analytically on the areas where you lack as to how should you work upon it. A great sportsperson is the one who practice daily and never let anything faints his spirit. It’s discipline to master your passion that matters. It’s the amount of energy that give you in each day to get something productive out of it.Passion does not come from waking up one day and saying OH, this is something I like doing. It’s an iterative development. It’s the result of burning midnight oil for years. It comes through sheer perseverance and hardwork. You acquire passion for something, when you do it repetitively and you feel you are really good at it and you have this belief that you will make it to the best. When you are in the initial years of developing a hold on a skill, never let your corrupt mind destroy your passion in the early stage. Stay discipline in the initial few years, suffer the pain and still keep doing it. That’s how you make that thing your passion and flaunt about it. Only you know, the amount of work that you have poured in to make it happen.It is that easy to become Sachin Tendulkar just because you have a passion for cricket? Is it that easy to become millionaire just because you like having money in your pocket? Yes, if you keep developing your skill, you analyse your work each day and don’t give up, your passion will help you get what you want. So, passion is not an inherent skill that people have. People develop passion by working day in and day out and not letting destructive thoughts come in their way.All these years, I have fooled by brain and have followed my heart. I like sleeping, staying in my comfort zone. This is what my heart allows me to do and it over shadows my brain commands. I like eating outside food and brain commands, it may disrupt your health. I shut him up, saying you don’t know what I like, you are just a program bot. ",
